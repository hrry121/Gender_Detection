# 👤 Gender Detection using Caffe Model

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a deep learning-based Python application that can **detect and classify gender** (`Male` or `Female`) from a face in an image or real-time webcam feed.

---

## 📌 About the Project
This project leverages **Deep Learning** to predict the **gender of a person** using facial features.

- ✅ **Face Detection** is handled using a pre-trained **TensorFlow** model (`.pb` and `.pbtxt`).
- ✅ **Gender Classification** is performed using **Caffe-based** deep learning models developed by **Tal Hassner** and **Gil Levi**.
- ✅ Input can be either an image or a real-time webcam stream.

> 🔍 Gender classification output: `Male` or `Female`
