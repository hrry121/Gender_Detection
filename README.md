# Gender-and-Age-Detection

## Objective

## About the Project
This Python project uses Deep Learning to identify the gender of a person from a single face image or using webcam feed

- **Face Detection:** Performed using a TensorFlow model (`.pb` and `.pbtxt` files).
- **Gender Prediction:** Performed using pre-trained **Caffe** models by Tal Hassner and Gil Levi.

- **Gender Prediction:** `Male` or `Female`
